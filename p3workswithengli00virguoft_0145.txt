160. Latinorum. ,A hypermeter syll. is
found here, which some copies have obviate-d
by writing Latini. The latter reading is
approved of further, on the ground that
ardua tecta may be Justly applied to the
palace of Latinus, though not to the abodes

of his poorer subjecta. But there is no rea-

has shown by reference to xii. 131 sq„ that
such was not the ease as represented by
the poet. The reading Latinorum may be
defended on the three following considera-
tions:-lst‚ Line 161 shows that the whole
city is spoken of—2d‚ Virgll takes every
opportunity to magnify the town Lauren-
tum and all things belong-ing mereto—and,
ad, The houses even of the poorer inhabi-
tants, though not high in themselves,

{liiay yet be so from their elevated posi·
on.

161. Mur-o subibant—‘⁸ were nearing the
wall.” Some copies read muro-3, but this,
says Wagn. (following Wolf), would mean
that they were actually enteriny the city,
muro, the dat„ being employed to signify
mere approach to. Forbiger opposes Wag-
ner's opinion as to this distinction between
the dat. and aec. with subire, and shows
by examples (iii. 292, vi. 13, compared
with viii. 125, 362, and x. 798), that the
principle cannot be carried out. The pri-
mary meaning of the aec. and dat. cases
certainly lenda confirmation to Wagner's
view of the essential and primitive differ·
ence between the two modes of expression,
but the approaching to a position close
under the wall of a city, is so nearly allied
to entering the city, that we do not wonder
at the confusion of the constructione and at
their indiscriminate use.
