NOTES ΟΝ THE AENEm.

B. vm. 27-47.

Pallas: part of these sall down the Tiber to the assistance of Ascanius, while AEneas,

with the remainder, crosses to Agylla—a most flourishing town of the

Tyrrheniam, now

at deadly feud with their banished tyram, Mezentius, and his ally and protector, Turnus

(454-519).

But, meantime, Vulcan, at the request of Venus, fabricates armour for

AEneas (370-453). These are brought by the goddess to her son, who is lost in admira-
tion at their wondrous beauty, and traces with delight, on the heaven—made shield, the
glorious deeds of his descendants for many generations (520-731).

1. Siynum extulit. Referring to the Roman
custom, afterwards adopted, of calling out the
cavalry and infantry, by displaying for the
former a blue flag, and for the latter a red,
from the capitol. furnus takes the lead, as
the previously arranged ,son-in-law and
successor of Latinus, the old king having,
as we have seen, resigned the authority.

3. Impulit, i.e., movit [cum sona]

6. Primi—principal, of chief authority.
On Messapus, see vii. 6913 on Ufens, vii.
7453 and on Mezentius, vii. 647.

9. Diomede, one of the Grecian princes
who had fought against Troy, returned to
Argos after the campaign in Asia, but soon
lest it again, and, after many wanderings,
at last settled in the south of Italy, and
married the daughter of Daunus, kingof
Apulia. He became partner in his father-
in-Iaw's kingdom, and founded Hippius and
other towns. On the urbem, Arqyripa,
here referred to, see xi. 246, and on the
result of this embassy to Diomede, xi. 226.

1⁸). Consisteae—stronger than considere,
inasmuch as it signifies not only the act of
settling, but the condition of rest and quiet
lollowing thereon. It may be translated
“oetablish themselves.”

13. Multas qentes adjunyere. Wagner
finds fault with the poet for introducing
nations as allies of the Trojans, of whose
league with AEneas no mention has been
made. He also censures the story of the
embassy to Diomede, as brought in merely
to give occasion for his highly finished des-
cription of the interview between that
pri11202e5a313l5theralmhalssadors, as recoffiedhiss
xi. — . ie , owever, remar
the phrase multas qentes is not to be consi-
dered a historical fact, but only as the words
of the deputies, who wish to magnify the
uffan, in order the better to induce Diomede
to lend his aid.

16. Eventum puqnae—not merely the
“issue of the baulan—victory, for, of course,
he would wish for that; but the benefits
that would flow to him from the defeat of
his enemim. C'upiat-“ expect.”

20. On this line, see notes, AEn. iv. 285.

22. This simile is taken from Apollonius

Rhodius, iii. 754 sqq. On tremulum, see
vii. 9, above.

w. Imaqine Lunae-not the moon herself

simply, but her reflected nmen, in the danc-
fllg >and unsteady motion of which the point
of the comparison lies.

2157.εῶ laqueatae, see AEn. i. 726.

27. Alituum and pecudum are expressed
as species, in apposition to the qeneric tem
animalia. The form alituum for alitum Is

etc.

30. Dedit quietem per membra-an odd
phrase. A common expression is somnus ·
diditur, or sparyitur per corpus, or per
membra, so here, by a slight modification
of the expression, AEneas is said, dare quie-
tem per membra.

31. Ipse—“in his own person.” Deus

loci, ἐπιχώριος θεός. The bank ortheriber
was at one time lined with poplars. Ob-
serve populus (fi), a poplar tree, but populun
(m.), the people.

34. Car-basus. On the proper meaning of
the word, see AEn. iii. 357. Here, however, ·
it means a laroc yar-ment made of tinen, or
rome other lium cloch. River-gods are usu-
ally represented in works of art with a
robe of the kind just noted thrown over
their shoulders or thighs. .

36. Troianam urbem, ie.. the remains of
old Troy, and the elements of a new one

37. AEterna—“ so that they be imperish-
able: '’ another instance of the proleptic use
01· the adj. See AEn. ii. 736.

Revehis—said with reference to the Italian
origin of Dardanus. See iii. 167.
39. Certa domus—like propria domus, iii.
85-—“ a sure and lasting abode.” ¹
'dud Concessere, ie„ resederunt, “have sub-
si e '’
42. Jamque tibi, etc„ indicates the camo
why AEneas should take courage. Heyne

considers 42-49 inclusive, as spurious, and -

reads “concessere deum. Nunc qua ratione
quod instat'’ in one line. His grand objection
is that the repetition of the prophecy ot
Helenus (iii. :388 sqq., -where see notes) is
unnecessary and unadvisable. Doubtless
43-46 occurred at the place quoted, but in
{tigheffirfflssssssssi {ffepssssssfflybssffi
doubt, justi'fied in giving his hero 'the very
great consolation of hearing a former fa-
vourable prophecy repeated hy a deity m
person, and that, too, in the very words in
which it was first communicated.

47. Ex quo, sciL, tempore. Heyne. Others
say, “according to which omen.'' But
Guenther‚ Jahn, Hand, and Forb. seem
nearer the truth, in making it equal to α·
quo loco, “From which place will rise tho
city of Ascanius.” It is to be noted, how·

also found in Lucretius, Manilius, Statius, ’ ¹
