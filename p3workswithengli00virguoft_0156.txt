men is applied to the end of life as well as
to the beginning of it.

Some make portus the gen, thus, (eqo
sum) omnis in limine portus‚· or, (quies est)
omnis in limine portus. But the first method
is preferable.

ιιῗ99. Funere—death, simply,—not obse-
q es.

600. The abdication of Latinus may be
considered too hasty, and quite uncalled
for. But, as Heyne remarks, it was neces-
sary for the poet's designs that Turnus
should possess sovereign authority. For,
as the praises of AEneas are brought out by
contrasting him with the Italian hero, this
exalting of the Trojan prince could not have
been dogne duly had his rival acted only m
a subordinate position.

601. The mode of declaring war in more
recent times is by a poetical anachronism,
quite allowable, attributed to the ancient
days of legend. Cf. Livy i. 19, and see
Rom. Antiq. (Ramsay) on the ceremonies
attending the commencement of hostili-
ties.

Protinus—“right onward from that time.'’

602. Albanae urbes—the thirty Alban co-
'onies M‘axinuz rerum—⁶ ‘mightiest of cm-
pires,' '‘or mistress of the worldst‘

603. Movent Martem, a rare expression,
the usual one being Bellum, or Mars, mo-
vetur. It is = movent arma in Heyne's
opinion. Others think reference is made to
the custom of beating the sacred ancilia ιιι
the temple of Mars, οιι the proclamation of
war, and to the cry of the pricsts,‘ ‘Mars
υἰςγίῑαι,Π οιι the occasion.

604. ΤΙιθ following passage is, of course,
Intended to flatter Augustus, and to com-
pliment his military renown. We are not
to follow the poet with too great historica]
strictness in his references, but allow him a
little latitude.

The Getae are put to represent generally
the barbarous nations of the west, conquered
by Augustus, such as the Cantabri and
Astures in Α.σ..ο 729, the Aquitani (by
Messala), etc. etc.

605. Hy reanis, see iv. 367. Arabis, re-
ferring, probably, to the expedition of
Acilius Gallus through Egypt to Arabia
Felix ιιι Am. c. 730.

Aa Indos refers, of course, to the Parthian
expedition ιιι Am. c. 734, when the Indians
sent an embassy to Augustus. See vi. 795.
The student should take care to make con-
stant reference to his Hist. of Rome, and
not content himself with these meagre no-
tices of events.

606. Auroram sequi, i.e., to go to the
most eastern parts of the world. Parthos,
in reference to the restoration by Phraates
in auc. 734, of the standards taken from
hagcfeated Crassus-an event which the

610. Nec custos, etc. The poet seems to
depict the temple as one with two entrance&

guarding each. ⁷

euphcmistic name, anacolmcehon (see ΕΠ.

stridentes. But see AEn. i. 573.

612. Trabea Quirinali—⁴ ‘the robe ο ‹‚
Romulus, '' ie„ worn by Romulus, as also
by the kings. Ovid often calls Romulus
trabeatus. The trabea is said to have been
a robe of a white colour, ornamented with
many purple stripe pes, like beams (nabet

it or sewed on it.
