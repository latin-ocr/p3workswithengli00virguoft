says that ferant is used as descriptive ot·

narrative.

100. Sol recurrens—“where the sun, in
his daily revolution, beholds both oceans,''
ιο.. that at the east and that at the west
limit of the earth.

Cf. iii. 284.

106. Reliqavic ab aqqerc ripoe, i.e.‚ moored
the ships so that the ropes sloped down
from the high summit οι· the bank to the
vessels. Forb. We disapprove however,
of this very close adherence to the literal
meaning of the words ab ayqere. No idea
of slopiaq down seems to be intentionally
implied, but simply the nature and position
of the holdfast. For it is very common
with both Greeks and Latins to designate a
point in space by a word denoting nwtion
from, or separation from, that point, since
beginning and extending from a point imply
contiguity and contact with that point.
Thus a dextro cornu, “on the right wing;''

{meam “in the rear,'' “hbehindr' literally
⁸⁸ from the rear.'’

107. We have in the following passage
the fulfllment of the prophecy (see iii. 255
sqq.) ot' “ eating the tables.”

108. Deponunt—see AEn. i. 698.

109. Λάονεα liba—‘⁴ And place along the
grass wheaten cakes beneath the fiands.—
ιο Jupiter, in the prophecy formerly indicated
(such is the force of ille, sor illo vaticinio)
suggested, and pile up wild fruits on the
cereal (wheaten) base.” Solum, says Ser-
vius, is used of that which supports any-
thing—thus it here means the cakes which
serve as places. ‘¹ The cakes were made of
wheaten fleur, with honcy and oil, and were
generally used on sacred occasions. They
were onomat, and marked off into quarters
(quadris 115) by a cross drawn ou the sur-
faoe.” Anthou. See illustration‚ AEn. i.

¹ 701.

114. Violare is used because the cakes
were considered sacred from their connexion
with the destinies of the Trojans (fatalis
ονωιί.)

116. Heus, “ha''l an exclamation indi—
cating a sudden thought, but not implyIng
ories or facetiousness.

117. Nec plura alludens—without j0king
further, or playing upon the word (mensa.)

118. Prima tulit, i.e.‚ was the first indica-

come when they were to finish their wan-

119. Eripuit, “hastily took up,·· ὑπιλά-

Pressit. There are various explanatione
of this phrase. (1.) Vocem being under-
stood, the meaning is, “He checked the
voice of Ascanius, so that he might not run
the risk of saying anything ill-omened.
[This is the vulgar rendering3 but nec plena
alludens shows that the boy needed not ιο
be interrupted] (2.) He put his hand on
the mouth of AscanIus. [Burmann. but
perfectly ridiculous] (3.) Premere (vocem)
is similar to premere veseima, i.e.‚ to follow
close upon: so here, to &peak immediately
aster Iulus [Schirach.·—but the notion of
following has been already expressed in the
foregoing.] (4.) He hesitated for a little,
pondering within himself the words (animo
pressit). and when he sees all things to
agree with the oracle formerly declamo, he
immediately salutes the land ashis by right.
[Wagn. and Forb.] (5.) With vocem pre·
mere, compare the analogous phrases crimen
premere, and armamentum premere, to follow
up, to τιν-ρο, to insist upon. [Jahm—this
will give a sense most natural, and quite
consistent with eripmc gelng before-J

121. Penates-Encas shows on every
occasion, his great veneration for these
deities. He calls them fidi, “truths111,”
‘⁸ trustworthy,” on account of their propheey
inii i. 147, 162, 167. So now (122) he calls
Italy their domus and patria.

We hsve here an example· or Vir-ailino
dormtum, according to the commentator-s
(see Wagn.. Qnaest. Virg. xl.): for it was the
Harpy Celaeno, say they, and not Anchises,
that had declared this prophecy. Heyne
suspects that the episode of the Har-pies
was inserted after the poem was finished‚
and that it was only the death of the
author that prevented its being revised
and properly adjusted to the other parts.
Ruhk. and Gossr. excuse the poet, by saying,
that since neither Celaeno nor Helenus toit'
AEneas that the eating of the tables was te
be the immediate forerunner ot' the buildinss
of a city, it may be that Anchises informed
his son of this fact in the lower reglons.
