p203. AEquam—practising equity and jus-
tice without constraint and without laws.
cf. Ovid Met. i. 89 sqq.

204. Veteris dei, viz., Saturn.

206. Auruncos— an ancient nation of
Campania, between the Volscians and Cam-
panians, occupying both sides of the Liris.
Virgil considers them as Aborigines. Ut
does not reply to ita, but means how,

207. On Dardanus, see i. 380; iii. 107, 167.
The poet adopts that myth regarding him
which was most likely to prove agreeable
to the Romans. His ayris must be taken
with some latitude‚ as Dardanus was not
sprung from Latium, but from Corythus
(Cortona), in Etruria. See iii. 170. Samo-
thracia, hodie, Samothralci, an island in the
AEgean, off the coast of Mysia.

209. Hinc—“from this city sprung.” See
note, vi. 305.

212. Ilioneus, see ί. 521. as being the
sidest, speaks.

214. succedere, in the infin„ is put aster
subeyit in the irregular construction 3—the
subj. with ut would be the usual form. So,
in line 206. ut with subj. is put instead of
accus. and infinitive.

215. Reqione vice—‘⁴ in the direction of our
course.''
¹ 218. Olympo, ie„ from the east part of
ieaven.

220. Avo (laudet. Dardanus was son of
Jupiter by Electra.

222. The comparison of the Trojan war
to a tempest is very fine.

225. Si quem= quemcunque. Extrema
tellus refuso, etc. By this Wagn. thinks
Britain or Thule is meant, refuso implying
at all events that an island is intended,
since it is around such only that the sea
would flow so as to appear to run into itself
again. But refuso may also mean, “spread
widely forth.’‘ The following words, too,
indicate that a north country is meant.
Submovet, “removes to a great distance.”

227. The torrid zone is indicated, aud
especially the Lybian desert.

228. Diluvio is used of the destruction,
because the war had been likened to a tem-

destinies impelled, the continents of Europe
and Asia rushed into hostile collision‚ has
been heard both by him whom the earth,
at her utmost border, where the ocean
spreads out in boundless extent, removes
far from us, and by him whom the torrid
zone (playa solis iniqui), extended between
the other four (zones), separates from us.”

230. Innocuam, “safe,'' ie„ on which
we shall be unmolested; or it may mean,
“that on which we shall not beobliged to

harm others.” Diiderl. says that the word
was used by none but poets up till the
time of Pliny the elder. Undamque auram-
que, cto. Wagn. thinks this modelled after
the well-known expression used in forms
of banishment, aqua atque iqni interdicere
According to AEn. i. 546, note, we might
expect aura-3, but similar termlnations are
frequently pleasing to the poets. ἡ·

231. Indecores. This adj. is said to have
no nom. indecoris, but either indecor or in·
decorus.

235. Fide—in treaties. in keeping and
carrying out the provisions of which, there
is constant necessity for a bold mind and
fearless hand.

237. Every one will, iu reading this line,
think of Hom. 11. i. 14. precantia is to be
scanned as three sylla, precantia,- to avoid
the synizesis some books read precantum.
In connexion with the branches adorned
with fillets and carried in the hand, see
above, 154.

240. Imperia deorum, viz, the warnings
and orders.

241. Huc repetat, etc. 1t has been the
subject of much controversy what is the
subject of this verb. Some make it Dar-
danus; others AEneas, under the name Dar-
danus. But a comparison of AEn. iii. 94 sqq.,
and of iv. 345 sqq., will convince us that
Heyne, Wagu, Forb.. etc. etc.. are right in
assigning Apollo as the nom. to repetit.
'l'he punctuation is, Hinc Dardanus ortus.-
Huc repeticyussisque inq. uro. Ap.. etc, “To
this country Apollo recalls us,” etc.

242. Numici—see 150. All rivers were
counted sacred; but this is represented by
Virg. as especially so, perhaps in anticipa-
tion of the legend, that AEneas. after being
drowned in its waters, was deified.

243. Dat„ scil„ AEneas, rea: ipse, 220. The
subject is omitted, since there can be no
doubt who is the person sending the gifts.
even although Apollo is the individual most
recently mentioned. Heyne thinks that
Virgil had inserted the lines from 222 to 242
at a revision, but had not had leisure to
accommodate them, with sufficient exact-
ness, to the context.

b Proeterea, ie.. besides sending the em-
assy.

245. We have seen (AEn. i. 647 3 v. 260,
and elsewhere) that when the poet mention

246. Gestamen, which we found in iil. 286
meaning a skiold, here signifies the ensigns
of royaity generally-the sceptre, tiara, and
robes, bein gspecified particularly afterwards.
The tiara referred to is the Phrygian cap
(pileus), which was of a conical form, but
bent slightly forward and downward. Tho
