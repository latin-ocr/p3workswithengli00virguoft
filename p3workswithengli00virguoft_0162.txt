Ardeates are meant, on account of their
having vowed to the gods, a ver sacrans,
while labouring under the effecte of a
lague3 or because the race was conse-
crated (sacrata) to the Monuni or nm
Gons. Heyne. The second view is
strengthened by an inscription, in which
the Sacram are called sacerdotes (Maqnoe
matris.)

Labici, or, ens-Livy calls thern, Labicani—
the inhabitants of Labicum, in Latium.
Niebuhr thinks that virg-n wrote Lava-i,
but no manuscript supports his view.
