enumerated (623-817).

Α 1. Tu quoque, ie, as well as Misenus and of the warp

Palinurus, on whom see vi. 232 and 381.

2. Caieta—see 901 of 'precedingssook On
the different etymologies of the word, con-
sult Smith’s Dict. of Geog. The modern
name, Gaetu, perpetuates the legend.

Circe, but to have been gradually joined to
the mainland by the consolidation of allu-
vial matter

11. Solis filia, i.e., the famous Circe, on
whose history, see Class. Dict. She is called

because it was dangerous to approach them,
by reason of Circe's charms and sorceries.

terms. Ululare is an onomatopoeic word,
which has a representative in very many

languages-the Greek ὄλολῦζίιν, the Heb.
Hallelm'ah, the Celtic funeral cry (which
we shall not attempt to spell), etc. etc.
