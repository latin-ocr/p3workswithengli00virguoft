derived from Hom. 11. viii. 69, 81111 xxii.

727. Τ1115 81111 1118 two preceding verses
are by no means caresully finished. The

‹lerstands paona (so ⁹7⁰¹¹05 in Greek)-“the

movement of the scales-a most extraordinary
idea. May not 1118 1158 of labor be attri-
buted to Virgil's fondness for Greek imita-
tions? And as he translates Homer, word
101· word 111 1110 50001111 clause, may this
term not be an attempt to bring out the
idea of death and 1118 dead, expressed by

will mean “1188111,·’ 01· “the 1188188 01

merc repetition ot' the idea of the first,
only presented in 8 slightly different aspect.
We are aware that strong arguments may
bc urged against this interpretation, but
we feel, 81 1118 581118 time, equally strong
objections against the explanation first
given. For labor, used in 8 similar sense
to that we propose to assign to it here, see
xi. 416, and note thereon.

732. Deserit contains in it, or 81 least

meaning will be, “The treacherous sword

743. Implicac incertos orbes, i.e., 118 pur-
sues 8 circuitous and very irregular course,
not knowing what to do, or where to turn.

750. Puniceae pennae formidine-the rope,
or formido, with purple seathers set 111 11 at
intervals, to wave in the wind, and thus
terrify the beasts.

751. We prefer, with Forbiger, to omit
the commas aster eursu and latratibus, so
that venator and canis may be taken toge-
ther, as “the hound‚” ‘⁴ dog 011118 chase.''
Similarly we meet bellator equus, latrator
Anubis. ctc. 1f venator is taken to mean a
“huntsnian,” the comparison will not bo
properly balanced. 85 111 11181 0858 we will
have two parties (1118 hunter and his dog)
against one (the stag); while, in the event
85 11 happened there was but one (AEneas)
against one (Turnus). ·AEneas is 1110 dog,
and Turnus the stag, bnt who is the hun-
ter (venator)r Though the formido and
snares imply the agency of a Ituntsman,
yet the dog and the stag are 1118 two
main actors, and the two prominent object·
of contemplation, and in their relative 518185
81111 8015 1118 point of the comparison lies.
TransL, ‘⁸ As when a hound (venator canis),

758. Simulfuyiem-simul increpat. Forb.
considers this as one ot* those instances in
which the participle is used 101· 1118 finite
verb, asin ix. 488. Otherwise the clauses
will not be equally balanced, for simul-
simul, like et—et, ought to connect two
words or phrases 01 1118 581118 character.
Thiel thinks the simul is repeated to add
emphasis to the wei-dg he removes the
comma afterfuqiens.

759. Nomine quemque vocans—‘⁶ calling

munders usually followed so as to give no
