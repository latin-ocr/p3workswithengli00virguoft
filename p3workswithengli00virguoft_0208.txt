Β X. sii-403.

371. Aemula lauch, etc—“which now
omes sorward to rival my father's glory.

374. “Here does an exalted country de-
mand as its right you and your leader Pal-
las;'' or, “By this rond does our exalted
country demand the return of you and your
ieader Pallas.” Peerlk, offended at the
phrases reposcit and alca patria, suggests
Troia alce-ra poscit.

378. Deest to be scanned in one syllable—
ijesc. Troiam, scil„ notam, i.e.‚ the Trojan
uimp. Although their way horne did.not
lie by sea, yet he puts the sea before them
as an alternative, better, even with its
chauces of peril and missurtnue, than defeat
by the enemy.

382. mser-imma, ete.--“where the spine

and iii. 578. Rutulorum for Latinorum, u
in 512, Teucris for Arcadibus,

405. With this simile, cf. Hom. 11. xl. 155
sqq„ aud xx. 490 sqq. Optato—‘⁴ according
to his wish.”

406. The epithet dispersa is taken from
what follows, ῆι, the spread os the fire by
its own means, and not by the shepherd's
exertions. Heyne. But Wagner prefers to
refer it to the operations of the shepherd, on
account ot· the phrases correptis mediis, and
coire in unum, in which latter expression
the whole force of the comparison lies.

Silvis—either the woods proper, or the
stubble, or the rank crass among· the plan·
tations.

407. Mediis—the intervening parts.

409. Victor, Le„ voti compo-3.

411. Halesus—leader os the Aurunci—seo

384. Super. perhapsbetter written assorm-
ing one word with occupat (superoccupat,
as supervenire), is equnl to snper hoc,- thus
quem super would inean— ‘⁸ whom thus
mgaged.”

385. Ante is to be joined with excipit
On accipit, see lii. 332. incautum morte—-
“rendered heedless (regardless of danger)
ffiolisequence os the sad death of his coni-

on.

392. Indaekcreta suis—“unable to be dis-
tinguished by their friendsx, and a source of
mistake pleasing to their parents.” We
prefer to make suis refer to relatives and
acquaintances, and to apply parentibus to
their parents properly, who could distinguish
between them, but who were constantly
mused by the mistakes of casual visitors.
The redundaney ‘pt' suis as applied to pct-
rentibus, and the circumstance that indis-
creta belongs to proles and not to error,
lead us to this decision.

Baucia proles—‘⁶ sons of Daucus.”

394. Thymbre. Above he was called
Tlaymber, but such variation in proper
names is not unusualwith the poets.

395. “ Thy lopped—offright hand, Larides,
neeks for thee its owner,'' dominum being
understood to suum.

396. Micam, etc—“tiviteh and try to
grasp the steel once more.''

398. Viri, viz„ Pallas. Praeter sumentem
&qis—‘⁴ as he hastens past in liis chariot.”

400. Hoc spatium, etc„ ⁸⁸ This interval of

time, and so long dewy, was granted to Ilus'' ⁸

previous to his death. The next line ex-
plains that Pallas had hurled the spear at
lus, but that Rhoeteus drove rapidly past as
the weapon sped from the Arcadian's hand,
and received the wound aimed at nus.
403. Curru, i.e., e curru. Caedit arra—-

 

shIeld. Hcyne compares the llomerio
{ht-nse, συσταλςις ἓν ἀσπίδι, 01· i'eae’ διο-πί·
0217. Canens-see ii. 124. The father of

1 Halesus was a prophet, and knowiug the

fate of his son, had brought hin up to a
shepherd's life in the woods, remote froin
war and its incitements.

419. Telis sacrarunt—a phrase taken from
the idea that those who were appointed to
die were consecrated to the Dia· Inferi, or
Manes. Telis Euandri, i.e., to the spear or
Pallas. Others say that Euandri is used
{mauge Pallas had received the spear from

van er.

423. Before this verse we must supply
with Wagner, qnod sifeceris. Tua quercus,
i.e., the oak sacred to you. So Romulus
fixed the spoils of Acron on an oak sacred
to the shepherds, Liv. i. 10.

425. Inermum—this adj. is usually of the
3d decl., but the poets often use the more
antiquated forms, which are of the lst and
2d deeL, eg.. hilarus, ster-ilus, oracilus, mb-
limus, etc„ for the more commossending in
——is—is—e. See Kritz, Sall. «Ing. i. 13 Cat.

terreri.

vis belli''-Gossrau; or belli ammutium
in bello. Primus for primo. -

428. Nodo puqnae-the phrase is derived
from the wood-cutter's art, sor as the knot

resists the efforts os the wedge, so does the ’

warrior Abas baffle for a time the onsetn
of the soe: Heyne and Gossrau. other·
think that nodus has not reference to the
knots in timber, but to the knots of a cors⁸

see below, 730. On semianimis, see iv. 8, as difficult to untia, and as causing delay.
