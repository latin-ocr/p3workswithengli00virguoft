for the death osone of his heroes! 1f suffuso
mean simply “thrown on the ground,'' by
some accident or other, as Gossrau iu-
terprete, (though he gives no example ot
the wond in that sensa) then this will be
by far the most ready explanation ot* the
passage.

678. Armis iqnotis, i.e., with a strange,
novel, unusual kind of armour: his thorax,
and the covering of his shoulders, were the
hide of a bull, while his helmet was the
skin of a wolf's head, with the gaping juws
and white tceth showing visibly, as seen iu
the woodcut at note 666 os Bk. vii.

lapyqe2=lapyqim i.e.‚ Apulian.

680. Puqnatori is by some joined to cui,
signifying “his shoulders, as he entered
the battle, were covered,” etc. But it is
better to attach it to iuvenco, (which other-
wise would have no epithet) to deuote
the strength aiud ferocity of the bull, and
also to state more distinctly that with tuis
very bull Ornytus himself had fought. 11
puqnatori be put in apposition to cui, the

The word ululare, like its Ι curved hook, fitted sor dragging: so that

the weapon resembled a modern hedge-

671. For suffosso, the reading of the best
MSS.. Wagner adopts suffuso, which is
found in a few codices of inferior note. He
objects to the former on the ground that,
as suffosso means “stabbed from beneath‚‘'
a wound of that kind was impossible under
the circumstances, there being no intantry
'm the troops commanded by Camilla. But
is it at all improbable that such a blow
should have been inflicted by some warrior
who had been unhorsed‚ and who was
fighting his way on foot out of the battle
