Sine moro-“contrary to the law of na-
tlons.”

636. (laneae — properly applied to the
theatre‚ but here to the circus. On the
Maqni Circenses (ludi), see Ramsay’s Antiq.,
pp. 346, 347. Livy and others call these
games Consualia.

637. consumere—an inverted construc-
tion for consumens. Heyne. Wagner,
however. would govern con-sumere by sece-

ναι, which he takes out of addiderat.

638. Severi-s Curibus—“the rigid Cures.”
Cures, austere and rIgid in morality and
manners. See ix. 603. So Horace's Epist.
ii. 1, 25, says, nvidis Sabinis.

On Cures, see vi. 812, and above, vii. 710.

641. Parca. Most authorities say it was
a male and not a female which was sacri-

642. Mettius Fuffetius and his punish-

cicae, i.e., incitatae—‘⁴ driven to their
speed.” We have adopted Mettius as the
form of this name, in accordanee with

Niebuhr's view of it. The spelling of it is
very uncertain, and the varieties numerous.

648. Manem—the imp. for the pluperfi,
on which see AEn. iii. 187, and vii. 808.
The meaning is, “Then when the horses
were dragging you asunder, Ο Alban, you
would have willingly been true to your pro-
mises.'' Heyne remarks that though such
a disgustixig sight would be wholly un-
suited for a work of art of our day, yet it
was sufficiently pleasing to Romans who
shrunk not from witnessing the bloody and
fatal contests of gladiatore.

646-51. The siege of Rome by Porsenna,

” and the deeds of daring performed by Cocles
and Cloelia, form the fourth subject; see

Livy ii. 9 sqq. On the orthography oi
the name Porsenna, consult Niebuhr's Hist.
of Rome, vol. i.. p. 532, and Macaulay's

Lays of Ancient Rome.

650. Quia is adopted by Forb. and Wagn.
for the common quod, since quia assigns
external causes as the reason of anger,
whereas quod would suggest the thoughts
passing in the mind of him enraged—the
iztenzial causes. Quod is subjective, quia
ο Jec ve.

652. The fisth design —the Capitol be-
sieged by the Gauls, but saved by Manlius,
and the cackling of the geese.

In summo, scil, clipeo. That summo does

not mean the summit of the citadel is seen
by the term arcis, which implies the same

thim:

the mimic doors of that metal.

657. Terrebant—“were on the point or
gaming.”

659. Aurea, etc. “TheIr hair is of a
golden hue, and so are their gai-mente—
they are conspicuous to the view in their

times fastened to a close-fitting cap, as seen ι
