Virgil, even he is tamed down to a mere
idle allegory. Heyne. ¹

719. Timor is usually surrounded by
Niqht and Darkness, to add to the horror.

720. Undique conveniunt-the Trojans as
well as Rutulians, says Forbiger3 but the
connection surely forbids such an interpre-
tation. Why should those (the Teucri) upon
whom the war-god had sent Fuga and Timor
assemble became an opportunity of battle was

721. Animo—the sing. used with especiai
elegance for the plur„ as Geo. iv. 227, in

723. Qui casus—“what (evil) chance rules
the day (affairs'‘).

728. Demens, mmor-“infatuated in that
he did not see.'' The words qui non viderit

of the epithet. Observe the subJ. viderit in
this expression of the reason.

734. Aqnoscunt turbati, i.e., Aqnoscunt et
turbantur, as Wagn. shows.

737. Dotalis reqia—see vii. 52 sqq. Lau-

but especially v. 638.

742. Achillem—on this form see AEn. i.
458, and for a passage similar in character,
cf. AEn. ii. 549.

745. Vulnus, i.e., telum, the weapon about
to inflict a wound. Veniens agrees with
vulnus, meaning ‘⁸ just approaching him.'’

747. These words are uttered by Turnus,
but the poet gives us no warning of the
change of speaker, for which he is censured
by Peerlk.

748. Neque enim is, etc.
character similar (to you) is he who (now)
wields the weapon and deals the wound.”

749. Consumit in ensem—“ He rises to the
blow,” as he raises his sword, in order to
lend greater force to his stroke.
