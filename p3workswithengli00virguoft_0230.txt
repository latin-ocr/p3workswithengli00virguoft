path in a valley of the forest3 the curvus
anfractus of 522. On bivias saucee, see
below, 522, 525.

519. In ⁶10, Turnus had proposed that
Camilla should share the labour of com-
mand with him, and now he follows up that
plan by requesting her to undertake his
duties in that part which he assigna her, viz„
{tigna-inst the leJavis-sslry dds ⁴fluens, and the auxi-

es sen van e .

522. Valles),r an old form of the nom.. is
read b the best MSS. instead of vallis the
vulgar ection. Curvo anfractu, i.e., in the
high grounds over which the Trojans were
to pass there was a valley with a winding
deflle. Ar'rsractus [amb and frag, root of
frango] seems here to mean not simply a
winding—cz cimicia,- but a παν-νοω pass
with precipitem leriga, as the fuller des-
cription, in 525, appears to show by the
phrases, tenuis semita, angustae jauces,
and maligni aditus.

525. Maligna· aditus -— a
“scanty-,¹⁸ or “confined approach.''
lignus, quasi maliqenns, (so benignus bem·-
ἔσηκε.) means primarily. “of evil disposi-
tion,'' “ill-disposed,'' “malicious,'' and from
this, “dangerous.” From the idea 01
“want of inclination‚'’ or “ill-disposed,”
comes that of '‘niggardly.'' and from this
again “scanty,'' '‘petty.” So malignus
portus—“a harbour that shows no desire
to accommodate ships.''

526. The meaning is, “Above this pass
there is on the view-commanding heights
(speculis), and in the very summit ot* the
mountzg⁹ a plateau which no one would

‘⁴ niggard‚”
stla-

suspect o be there ( plorantes ignota, the lat-
ter wor applying to the extraordinary
position of such a plain, and not to the
circumstance of the Trojans knowing it or
not knowing it), and a place of safe retire-
ment (or conceahnent). whether you wish
to meet the enemy, attacking you on the
lest or on the right, or whether you desire
rather to assail him from the cliffs [or, to
take your scum! on the cliffs],‘ and roll down
upon him huge stones.”

531. Iniquis, i.e., “dangerous“ sor AEneas
to pass.

532. Opis—a. name sometimes applied to
Diana herself, but here to one of her atten-
dant nymphs.

536. Nostris armis—see 65⁶2 and 844,
below, On Camilla, see vss. 803 sqq.

539 sqq. This is one of the passages
which we believe Virgil would have altered
had he lived to revise his great oem. It
seems very absurd to introduce iana re-
cor(lin,‹.›,· to Opis, at such a critical moment,
facts in the history of Camilla, of which the

551. Subito vix. Vix refers to the diffi-

to the suddenness οι· the conception and
adoption of that now mentioned. It seems
very forced and uuuatural to take vta: as
