B. vm. los-125.

105. Juvenum, i.e.‚ men of military age.
Pauper senatus—the happy poverty of those
ancilent times is a subject of frequent praise
to t e oe s. .

108. pAllabi, scil.. rates-the ships and their
crews; for incumbere remis follows, from
which remis may be easily supplied remiqes
(the power) as the subject to incumbere.
The oars are called taciti—“noiseless,'’
because they made no splashing in the
smooth water, a circumstance which the
Arcadians would not readily understand
when they saw rowers rising to the stroke
und yet heard no noise, though the 'trojans
were pulling, in their opinion, against an
adverse stream. Servius supposes tacitis to
mean that the rowers were silent, not in-
dulglng in the celeusma. Thiel says, “be-
cause they had now reached the shore, and
ceased to row;” but allabi and procul (112)
show that this could not have been the case.

110. Vetat rumpere sacra (same as men-sis,
above). It was an act of impiety to inter-
rupt a sacrifice, and if any such interruption
took place, the rite should again be per-
formed de novo. See Livy ii. 86. Quos=et
eos,- scil„ epulantes.

113. Jynotas vias—for he sees, on anearer
approach, that they are strawers.

114. Qui ρεηαεὲ-τῖνες ‘rb ’γίνος- Thus
Ovid Fast. iv. 66, Graius uterque venus:
and so omne oenus, id oenus, and quod venus,
in which the accus. is used adverbially‚ ln-
stead of the gen. of quality, id oenus being
equal to eius ceneris. This construction
seems an extension of the principle of the
‘⁴ Accusative os Reference or Limitation‚” for
which see i. 228. See Zumpt, Lat. Gr. ὅ

428, and Madvig, Lat. Gr. ᾗ 238.
Unde domo, i.e.‚ unde venitis (estis) domo,

πὸθεν οἴκοθεν. The phrase is of frequent
occurrence in Latin writers. See Hor. Ep.
1. 7, 53, abi, quaere et refer, unde domo, quis,
cujus fortunae, etc. Domus is osten used for
patria. See AEn. x. 141.

117. Tela inimica. AEneas was aware
that this expression would at once gain him
faivour with Evander, as 55, above, will ex-
p am.

119. Hoec, i.e., this message.

121. Tanto nomine, viz., Dardaniae or
Trojanorum.

122. Wagner considers quicumque as a
voc.. and therefore omits the comma aster o.

NOTES ΟΝ THE AENEID.

B. VIII. 127-14a

127. G'ui precariis used here inthe un-
usual sense “to supplicate a person) Pre-
cor, with the dat„ generally signifies either

to “imprecate some evil on a person,'’ or -

‘⁴ to pray on one's behalfi” In th1s instance
the dat. is perhaps attributable to the poet's
desire for brevitv, which led him to use the
case required by the second verb praeten-
dere, leaving the render to supply quem aster
precari. He would thus have written fully
ffiffifflsstssfflfflffiffi “that 1
should hold forth before me branches decked
with the woollen fillets.'' On the origin of
the brmch as an emblem of peaceful inten-
tion Ruhk. remarks, “Men in a ruder age
seem to have arrived at this rite in a very
simple way, since hy seizing any chance
branch they shewed that they were un-
armed, and that they meditated no 111. The
emblem was found, by early discoverers, to
be used among the uncivilized natione of
Amerlca for a similar purpose.”

130. Geminis conjunctus Atridis—stom two
sisters daughters of Atlas, the Atridoe md Δ
Evander were sprung. By the same daugh-
ters of Atlas there was a relationship (134
sqq.) between AEneas and Evander, for
Dardanus was the son of Jove and Electra
(daughter of Atlas), while Evander was
called the son of Mer-cury, whose mother
was Maia (daughter of Atlas). The object
of countinq kin here is obvious.

131. Mea virtus, ie, my confidence of
mind arising from a consciousness of merit
and of right. We excuse in the ancients
that self-glofification which would disgust
us if met with in our own day. They had
no newspapers.

132. Terris (ie, per terras) didita—“pub-
lished over all lands.”

133. Fatis eqere volentem—‘⁸ urged me on
under the influence of·the Fates, 1 myself
too being anxious to come.”

134. Dardanus—see AEn. i. 3803 iii. 167
sq.‚ and vii. 206 εᾳὲ. ,

136. Αᾱυεὴίιυν eucros, sor ad Teucros,
i.e.‚ in Tr0adem3 see AEn. 1. 2, 3075 vii. 216.
Dardanus reaches the Troad, which Teucer
then held, and there builds the city Dar-
danus, but his son Ilus founds Ilium. The
father, however, may even thus be called

primm auctor Iliacoe urbis.

138. Candida Maia—“the beautiful Maia.”

teron (“the cart before the horse ''), on
