gentive oft suppooed 01111100, like the Greek

γάρ, and interpret, “AEneas recognised

110 had already fought with him ἲ] and being
rejoieed prays ns follows.” All os these
methods are so unsatisfactory. that we are
nt ιι 11100 to select the ⁸* least of evil.³.'' We
must look on the passage aa oue of those
marked out by the poet for revision and al-
¹tfarution. A few hirei-ior MSS. read eum

880. Nec divum parcimus veui„ Le.. 1 re-

nor «io 1 dread any one of the gods, even
those whom you, AEueas, mention (in 875).
May not Mezentius refer to the divine ori·
gin of AEneas, in a taunting and bitu-ny
sumasne way? ¹⁶ Ι have no particular
dread of death myselt'. nor have 1 any su-
perstitious scruples about inflicting a wound
on any deity;'' (this is said with derision
either in reference to the pedigree of AEneas,
or to the msistanoe rendered to the 'trojan
hero by his mother Venus in the conibet
with Diomede, which story we must ima-
oeine was by this time known to Mezentius).
The following 11110 would seem to confirm
this view. its venio moriturus answering to
nec mortem hotv-emus. and its haec ’nm
