Β. vm. 672-681.

672. Caerula means simply, ⁸· the sea-
plains,'' and can have no reference ιο colom·
here, as that is already decided by the term
aurea. Forb.

fluctu cano—to represent the white ap-
pearance ofsea-breakers the artist must have
avaned himselfor silver along with the gold.

673. Amano clari, candentes armo.

675. In medio, sen„ οι· the ahiem, not ol
the sea. Heyne. But as the central part or
the shield has been already mentioned in
671, it Is perhaps better ιο take it ιο mean
the middle of the sea, or at least the middle
of the centro piece. Actia bella stands in
apposition to classes with a peculim-Ity of
construction which will be found explained
in note, Ecl. ii. 3. Bellum Is sometimes
⁴3need for puqna as here, aud at AEn. 51.

676. Cernere erat—a Greek construction,
on which see note, Geo. iv. 447.

677. 'l'he promontory Leucate (on which
see AEu. m. 2⁷4) is said fervere, while the
fleet is of course the proper object to which
thehverb should be applied. Auro, aen..
o t e armour.

678. Hinc Aumcsms—so hinc Antonius,
685. Μ. Agrlppa was the admiml of the
whole ficet, Octavianus, with M. Val. Mee-
sala, and others, acting as general superin-
tendents. The poet takes care, 679, ιο ln-
troduce the patres and populus, to give his
patron a show of disinteresoedness, and an
appearance os public sanction. Observe the
monosyllabic termination of the line aster a
spondee, a combination which gives great
force and dignity ιο the line. See AEn. fl.

250, note3 and Geo. i. 181.

680. Tempora vomunt gemmas flammas
—not from his eyes, but from ms helmet:

“rlaee to view.” On the Julian star here
referred ιο, see Ecl. ix. 47. During· the
