612. Many critics reject this and the next
line, which are not found in many ot· thu
best MSS„ and are not mentioned by Sera
vius or Donatus. They occur, with th!
alteration of two words, in xi. 4¹11, Ξ.
Wagner, however, defends them, (1) Be-
cause they are not identically the same οι
xi. 471, but are changed, according to Vl?-
girs practice, in a word or two. (2) Be-
cause, if they are omitted, there is some-
thing wanted to complete the sentence; for
nowhere in Virgil does an absolute clause
end in the nom. of the participle. (3) Be-
cause in the Codex Mediceus (one of tho
best MSS.) 611 ends a page, so that 612
and 613 might have been readily omitted.

taken notice of the verses when commenta-
