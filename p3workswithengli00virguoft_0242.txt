ther thinks that fatalis maram is used with
ᾳ double meani11g; for the phrase, “that
fated band,” may signify both, ‘⁶ that band
which thinks itself called on by fate to
avenge injuries,‘' or, “ that band which has
come to receive its ῆιῐεε,Π i.e., its destruction.

234. Aris Heyue takes as equal to ad aras,
ln the sense, “he devotes himself to death
in defence of the Latius, a league having
- been ratified at the altars of the gods.''
But Wagner refers the phrase to the pro-
posal of ‘Eneas in 192, sacra deosque dabo,
and explains it as meaning “son'’ i.e., “in
‹lesence of the altars of the gods.” This is
to be preferred.

235. Feretur vivus per ora, i.e., his me-
2¹2?1{y113¹;²1¹1¹1⁵.i{¹‡ igafffffissahffnzffizi'fflss
countrymen, even after his bodily death.

237. Qui suggests the reason of defeat—-
‘⁸ because we now are remiss.''

243. Infectam precantur foedus—“pray
that the league had never been made-'⁹
Verbs ot' “wishing '’ are very frequently
construed thus with the perf. part. pass. ⁷

Iniquum sortem Turni — either. “the
pitiable lot of Turnus ;’' or “the unjust lot,‘'
as Turnus was obliged to fight single-
hfindgd, iu consequence or the cowardice of
a ot ers.

. 245. Siquam—“a portent,’' the same as
monstro in next line. praesentius—‘⁶ more
effectualiy.”

252. convertunt fuqam, i.e., cesse to fly
before the pursuer, and in turn become
themselves the pursuers of the eagle. Con-
vertere viam Is similarly used.

256. Prcn'ecic fluvio is another instance of
the constructio praegnans. The abl. fluvio
comm after the verb of motion projecit,
instes-5 of the accus„ expresses not only
the hurliug towards the stream, but also
the being in it. See note, AEn. ii. 18. ¹

258. Expediunt manus - “make ready
their hands,” viz.. to take armour. 'rho
more usual phrase is expediunt arma.

259. Saepe cannot, if literally taken, be
very applicable to so short a period as that
during which the war had been carried on.
Wagner, therefore, considers it as und for
ter, ter quaterque, Le„ valde, vnaompere.
Accipio, scil, omen. Observe the repetition
of hoc in this line, and of me in the next.

263. On populat see i. 527. And on the
syntax, quos territat, et mora populat, cf.
x. 242, and Ecloguc viii. 3.

274. sutilis balteus, i.e., one made ot
woollen eloth, or of hide, but most probably

florias ox 'rim meib.

275. Juvenem—coseas vamadioit. ob-
serve the two accusatives following the ono
verb. This is an example of the construo-
tion (explained in 161, above) in which the
whole (juvenem) is first mentioned, ln ε
general way, and then the costas
specially affected is more particularly de'-
tailed. In Greek this syntax is very oom-
mon.

277. Fratres—pa ars. See above
note on 161, Interea reyes—Latinm—strnw.
See also xi. 887, exclusi-pan—pars.

281. Ayyllt'ni, Le„ Etruscmis, inhabitants
of Agylla or Caere. On the syntax amr
decernere see note, ii. 10, with the references
thero quoted.

283. In this very vivid description ot au ,

irregular and tumultuous fight we are, ol
course, to understand the different operations
as assigned to different individuals. Some
carry off torches from the altars and use then:
as weapons; others hurl Juveuns so thiclpy
that a shower of iron hails down on the
combatant33 others carry off the sacred
vessels, and plunder the hearths ot· the gods
This last actlon is perhaps not one ot‘pl'tmder
but ot· protection.

286. Refer-ens pulsatos deos. As we sm unt
told that Latinus brought any images ΜΨ
him to the sacrifice, and as we do not
know that it was customary to heve puel·
present at the making of treaties, we uum
not apply these words literally t'o the actum
carrying back of the deities to Laurentum.
We must either take the phrase figurativelffi
“returning to Laurentum, his divine ordi-
nances and ceremonias being mocked and
baffled by the unsuccessful attempt to make
a league ;” or else we must consider afferens
as equal to amicans. as it isin AEn. iv. 329.
The former we prefer.

290. Messapus rushes cagerly against
Aulestes. desirous to cut off all chance ot
reconciliation (avidus confundere foedus),
by ¹slsying a king, or Lar, of the Tyrr-
hen ans.

Avidus confundere. This infinitive qt· in-
teneion depends on the adi. avidus, in Greek
fashion. A prose writer 01· the Augustum
age would have used either ad with the
gerund, or the dative of the gerund, oruc
ur qm· with the subjunctive. See note,
AEu. i. 527.

291. Proterret—“by terrifying‚ puts to
ssight ;'' adverso equo—‘⁶ by riding his horse
riyht ac him.''

292. Aulestes stumbles against the altars
which are opposed to him as he reti-estu,
keeping his t'ace to the foe.
