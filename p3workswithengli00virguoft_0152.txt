398. canit-the last syll. long by arsis,
and that, too, though a short syn. sueceed,
which is very rare. Wagn„ Quaest. Virg.
xii. 11, lays it down that such a peculiarity
occurs only when the verses, formed on
the Greek model, approximate either the
Choriambie or Anapaestic rhythm. Cf.
Geo. 1. 138; iii. 1893 AEn. i. 3083 and see
note, Ecl. i. 393 iv. 51.

tial song, rolling wildly her blood-shot eyes

410. Danae· Acrisioneis—Danae, daughter
of Acrisius, is said to have been wafted to
Italy and to have founded Ardea. (See
Smith's Dict. of Geog.) Niebuhr thinks
this legend goes to prove that Ardea was
founded by Pelasgians. Ardea was the
capital of the Rutuli. It was besieged by
Tarquinius Superbus-was made a Roman
colony in 110. 311 —was afterwards de-
stroyed by the Samnites, and 111 1118 111118 of
Virgil had almost no existence as a city.
Its site is about twenty-four Italian miles
from Rome.

411. Delata is by some referred to dea,
but by others (Wagn., Forb., Gossr., etc.)
it is considered as belonging to Danae, to
describe her sea voyage.

412. Tenet has here the meaning “to
hold good‚'' “to be current,'' “to remain‚''
(on which use of the verb see Ruperti on
Livy i. 4, 9): maynum nomen is therefore
the nom. to tenet. “And now the great
name, Ardea, remains.” Wagn. and Forb.
The second Ardea is in contrast to the line
following.

413. Sed fortuna fait, 18, abiit, aufaqit.
It is unneeessary to quote AEn. ii. 325,
fuimus Troas, fuit I lium, or to point out the
peculiar force of the expression. The kind
