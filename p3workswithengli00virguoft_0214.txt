that a much simpler, and, at the same time, above, 180, 400. Uni—“ against him alone*

more suitable interpretation, is afforded by
resolving quos into its equivalents et hos
(thr, as already stated, i. 232, a relative,
whether pronoun or conj unction, is equal to
a demonstrative and a conjunction). The
lines we consider as spoken by Turnus with
bitter and sels-upbraiding feelings, and we
translate them thus: “And have Ι-Ο ae-
cursed acti—abandoned all these on the
brink osa hideous death, and do Ι now see
them struggling in ssight, and do 1 hear the
groans ot* the falling ?'' In soliloquies of
regret for bad fortune, or ill-managed affairs,
or In self-reproaehing reflectione we often
thus begin our sentences with au “and,”
which connects our coming words to some
tancied atterance or thought theh has
preceded. Anthou says quosne is equal to
eosne, but this is absurd.

675. For the common reading dehiscet,
the subjunctive dehiscat is adopted by
WVagner, and almost all succeeding editors,
on the ground that “Turnus pronounces
this very thing most miserable, viz„ that
even though he exceedingly desired it, yet
he could not be swallowcd up by the earth,
ns heis now borne on the surface of the sea
-a doubt and even impossibility which
potius ln the following line shows was pre-
sent to his own mind.” All readers of

Homer will at once call to mind, ‘2'5‘1‘5 μοι
χάνοι εὐρεῖα χθών.

677. Volens-—“heartily.'' Observe the
great force lent to the expression by the
use of the proper name Turnus, instead of
the pronoun eqo. “It is Turnus himself
prays to dash this his bark against the
pointed erags or rocks, and to hurl it on the
tnerciless shallows of some boiling quick-
sand.” Syrtis is to be taken as the gen.
sing, governed by vadis, and not as the
accus, equal to in Syrtes.

680. Fluctuat animo—“ho wavers in his
mind, (inelining) now to this resolve, now
to that.''

681. Induat sese mucrone, an inverted con-
struction, meaning to elothe, as it were,
and entirely conceal the blade in his own
body. Some books read mucroni iu the
dat„ iu which case the phrase is similar to
that used by Caesar, B. G. vii. 73, se ipsi
acutissimis vallis induebant, and may be
translated, “fell upon the bladon· Exciyctt,
next line, is stronger than aeliam: it means
to drive the whole sword tlzrouqh, how large
soever it be. -

686. Miserata animo—“pitying him 'in
her mind.'' Some copies, however. read
animi—“pitying his emotion‚’' “his ex-
cited feelings.”

691. Uni—uni. For other examples os long by arsis. Acron was from Corythus ⁴
