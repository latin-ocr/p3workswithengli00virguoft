823. Maluit-he wished the land to be
called Latium rather than Saturnia. La-
missen—Varro also derives Latium from la-
tere, not, however, on account of Saturn's

this is absurd. Abeken finds the root in
zatus, πλατύς, so that Latium would mean
“ the level and broad land.‘'

so called until the time of Servius Tullius,
in memory of the virgin Tarpeia, as was al-
leged. See Livy i. 11. It received its name,
Tarpeia, in the reign of Romulus, and
therefore the poet is guilty ef an anachron-
ism, which, however, is perfeetly pardon-
able. By Capitolia, the poet means the
Capitoline heights only, in his days crowned
with: fissplendid buildings hence aurea in
