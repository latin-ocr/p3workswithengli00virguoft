Β. X. 492-511

492. Qualem meruit, etc—1 st, as he (Pal-
las) desei-ved, being a bravo and valiant
youth. 2d, As Evander deserved. We
prefer the former. Remitto—“I send back”
to his country for buriaL Some think that
a sneer is contained in the words qualem
meruit. but we think no such idea is con-
veycd by them. Had feelings suggesting
such an insuit to the dead prevailed in
the mind ot* Turnus, he would likely have

· denied the right of sepulture to the body.

495. Hospitia—“his hospitable reception
of AEneas,'' the word being usedin an active
sense: but in 1. 671, Janom‘a hospitia, it is
found in a passive meaning.

496. Exanimem. On the different forms
of this adj. see note iv. 8. Baltez· to be pro-
nounced as two syllables.

497. Caesa manusjuqali nocte, The device
on the belt represented the murder of the sons
of AEgyptus by their wives, the daughters os
Danaiis. See Smith's 011133. Dict, and com·
pare Horace, 011. 111. 11, 26. Observe the irre-
gularity in the syntax. Caesa manus should
be in the accusative, in apposition to im-
pressum nefas, which is governed by rapiens,
but the poet departs from the construction
with which he set out (αηαεοίοιιίήοη), and
changes to the nominative, sor it would be
an awkward combination to say rapiens *
⁴¹ * caesam manum et thalamos. But if
we take from ami to cruenti as an exclama-
tory parenthetic clause, there will be no
ground for aceusing Virgil of carelessness,
er of a blunder.

For a phrase similar to rapiens nesae, see
viii. 731.

500. Gaudet potitus—ou this construction
1188 note, AEn. ii. 377.

502. Observe that servare is made co-
ordinate with sati and sortis, all these de-
pending on nescia. ⁶ Ah, human mind,
ignorant of fate and of future fortune, and
incapable ot= preserving moderation, when
elated by prosperity.''

503. “To Turnus the time will come
when he shall wish that Pallas were unhurt,
when he would purchase his safety at a
great ransom, and when he shall hate those
spoils, and the day on which they were
won.''

506. The scutum would seem t'rom this
passage, says Stipflius, to have been oblong
and oval, and made of a lighter material
than the clypeus. All will call to mind the
expression of the Laconian matrons when
delivering the shield ,to their¹ sons before

starting for the fight, n τάν, n ἔπ’) *τάν-
507. Dolor atque decus, i.e., a cause of
grief by your death: but a source of honour
by your bravo exploits.
511. “Α1111 now not merely the rumour
οἰκ great a disaster, but a trustworthy

struction, 388 notes, AEn. 11. 35ος v. 638.

514. &mitem—‘⁶ a path.” The. word is
applied to the cross paths or lanes, four ot
which were left by the Romans in their
fields, so as to afford easy access to differ-
ent parts of the crop for the purposes οἱ
cultivation.

517. Sulmone creatos. Sulmo is by scine

520. “And sprinkle the flames ot' the
funeral pile with the blood⁴ of the captives‘·
The avenging of Pallas, the bui-lai φῖ ibe
body, and the immolatiou of captives as 1⁰11-
feriae to the Manes (xi. 81), are horrowed

from Homer, in his description of the events -

connected with the death of Patroclus. See

524. Per patr-fos Manes. Pope remarks
on the great skill exhibited in this passage
in introducing a snppliant addressing tho
Pius AEneas with such adjuratione, the
Manes of 1113 father, and the hopes of 1113
3011.

527 The gold was either 111 unworked
masses (insecti), or in manufactured vessels
and ornaments (coelati, sacti).

531. “The talents of gold and silver
which, many 111 number, you speak of, re-
serve for your children.'' Gnatis is used
for the sing. (as in iii. 488, and i. 4), for we
sce by 525 that he had but one 3011.
