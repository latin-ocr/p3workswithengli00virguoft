. 526, 'Tlie Tuba· was said to have been
invented by the Tyrrheniam, hence the
epithet Tyrrhenus, which, however, is joined
with clanyor instead of tubae. Thus we
have had frequent examples of adj. joined
to substs. other than those to which they
properly belong. See AEn. i. 169; iii. 4113
v. 375, etc. In like manner au adj. pro-
perly ⁹belonging· to the governed (gen.)
case, as here, is. accommodated to the

governing word. 5 'See AEn. i. 4; vii. 44; ι

xii. 199, etc.

528. Ἀνηια, scil, those that were being

second clause as=audiune

marks—‘ ’κατὰ τὸ σιωπώμενον ῐηιρῑιῑρξφηω

542. Herculeis iynibm. There has been
much discussion on this passage. Of the
different explanations proposed by Heyne,
Jahn, Siipfl„ and Forb. adopt the following:
The iones Herculei which are now re-
kindled, can be none other than those which
were raised the day before on the Ara
Maxima in honour of Hercules (102 sqq.);
this cercmony‚ however, is performed, not
before the city at the altar of Hercules. but
in the palace of Evander (cf. 467 with 541),
and not in honour of Hercules, but of the
dii domestici of the king. Nothing remains‘
for us, then, but to come to the conclusion

“ that Evander had taken home with him the

fire and embers from the altar of Hercules,
and placed them on his family altars, and
that these are the sopitas iones now kincued
by AEneas to perform sacrifice to the Lares
and Penates.

Wagner thinks that the phrase implies a
double sacrifice, a second to Hercules on
the Ara Maxima, and one to the Lar of
Evander. See Forb. and Wagn ‚in loc.

Primum· is answered by posthinc in 546.

543. Hesternam Larem may mean either
the Lar to whom sacrifice had been made
the day previous, or the Lar with which
AEneas had become acquainted for the first
time on the day previous. ὓ

558. Euntis, scil, filit.

559. ΙΜαΨῑειιιε-ῐὴίε, aethe most difficult
reading, is preferred by Wagn. and For-b.

founds soul and body, it would appear: sor
while attributing three souls to Erilus‚ he
gives him only one body, but he seems to
forget that it is bodies and not souls that
wear armour. So say the commentators3
but may we not suppose that Evander, aster
slaying the monster, as he supposed, stripped
him of his armour, 'aud that a second lifo
animating the same body, a second suit of
arms was provided, to be again carried off
in triumph hythe Arcadian, and that in
like manner a third time was the same
ordeal gone through.
