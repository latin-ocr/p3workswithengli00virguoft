301. Tibi rebarque secundis, for the pro-
saic‚ tien· rebus secundis utenti.

302. Manebtmt, i.e.‚ servabuntur—will

303. According to the custcm of the
heroic age (see Hom. 11. x. 255), the giving
arms from one's own person was a mark of
great affection and confidence.

805. Gnosius—see AEn. v. 306, and Geo.
i. 222. The Cretans were famed for the
manufacture of arms. Habilem-see AEn.

306. Pellem horrentisque exuvias. ie„ a
hide taken off a shaggy lion. Similar
phrases are, in brevia et- tyrtes, AEn. i. 111 ς
veste fideique pelle leonis, ii. 722 3 cestus et
arma, v. 410. This figure is called epexe-

esis.

315. Ante. This word has given much
trouble to commentators: the most feasiblc
⁸¹¹ sisinii-³9¹¹ effigies&
“before they reached the camp.’' Others,
“ before they reached AEneas ;” but as they
did not succeed in reaching AEneas, this last
cannot of course be the true interpretation.

70, placata ventidium maria (i.q., placant) ;
Ter. Andr. iv. 1. 59, jam Ιιοσ tibi inventum
dabo. And· in like manner, when joined
with the simple acc. of a subst, it signifies

exhibere ‚· thus, fenestram dare, AEn. ii.
4823 tortae dare, v. 276.

324. Vocem premit may mean either, “ he

“ NOTES ΟΝ THE AENEID.

B. IX. 333-349.

But this seems not to be justified by the
text, since Remus is referred to in ae’pst‘ de· ,
mino of 332. Juxta has reference to what ’
goes before, and is to be translated, “ hard
by,” sciL, Rhamnes.

333. Singvlcantem — “bubbling forth.”
Tepes'acca terra et tori madent s-how much

more expressive is Homer's phrase, Boia-⁸-
δον B'o‘c'aeoev αἵματι θῦεν.

334. Tor! is the grassy conch of Remus.
not the high-piled bed of Rhamnes, u
Peerlk. supposed.

Nee nem, scil„ premit.

337. Multo deo, scil.. Baccho, ie, oino—
“overpowered by copious draughts of wine.”
See i. 636, note.

338. Aequas-set ludum nocti, Le, if he had
indulged in play throughout the live-long
night, and had protracted it till dawn. cf.
{Ion Od. iii. 8, 15, vigiles lucernas prefer in

339 sqq. With this passage cf. Hom. n.
x. 485 sq. The comparison has reference
to Nisus, bnt the direct application is not

Turbam, ie, driving before him the sheep
huddled together in tumultuous disorder

throughout the pen. Ιεεκλονῖυν of Homer.

343. In nicetio, scil„ spatio. In his lai-ger
edition, Wagner explained. the phrase to

smaller, “qui prope cubantes se meidandoe

345. anaros—“unconscious''—applies. ›,
as the sequel shows, to those mentione‘2
Rhoetus excepted. The form of exprq ion
is peculiar, but allowablc as poetic. ’

346. Sed (like γάρ) is often to be ex·
plained by an ellipsis as here—although he
saw all, yet he did not oppose Euryalum
but, sear-inq for himself, endeavoured to hide
behind a jar. These vases were sometimes
of immense size, so that the attitude does
not seem at all improbable.

348. Multa morte recepit—he drew back
his sword, (which was accompanied) with'a
copious stream of b100d; thus Heyne and
Wagn. Forbiger, however, comparing the
phrases, multa nocte, multo die, multo mane,
etc„ adopts the opinion of Siipfl. and Peerlk„
morte jam multum proqressa, ie, death
being now far advanced in its mog-ress, and
ἓεηὲἓις but this seems rather artificial and

349. Purpuream animam—“the purple
tide of life.” Voss conjectures purpureum
to agree with ensem, and his reading has
been adopted by Ruhk.. Jahn, and Gossr.;

phrases as φοινὸν &uffa Hom. Hym- Ap„
