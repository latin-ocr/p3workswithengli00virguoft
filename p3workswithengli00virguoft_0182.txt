Β. lx. 9-27.

9. Sceptra, ie.. regnum, regia. Palatini
-by anticipation, as is osten the case in
names, both with poets and prose writers.
We have many examples of simnar prolep-
sis in the Old Testament. Petit is, by
Heyne and others, considered the pere con-
tracted for petiit, but Wagner denies that
virgil ever uses such a synaeresis (see AEn.
iii. 3). Yet, even suppose the contraction
were allowed,‚,the pres, tense is that which
is most suitable, since it expresses more
distinctly the true state of matters, viz„ that
AEneas has not returned, but is still absent
on his search aster Evander, and other
friendlyaid. The last syll. of petitis length-
ened by arsis. See AEn. iii. 464.

Heyne proposes, to avoid the spondaic
ending ot· the line, to read Euandri iu four
syllabaes. But Wagner alleges that this

separation of the word εὗ in compounds is
not admissible unless before two consonants,

η ihm-popm or before a doubled liquid, as

σελμος.

10. Corythi· ad urbes, i.e., EtrurIa, which
is signified by Corythus, the founder of
Certona. See AEn. iii. 170, note.

11. Lydorum—another reference to the
vulgar opinion that Etrurians were of
Lydian orig-in. See viii. 479. On the con-
struction petit, penetravit, armat, see note,
ἄζῃ. ii. 4823 iii. 3.

12. On the construction tempus poscere,
see note, AEn. v. 638.

13. Turbata arripe castra, the meaning
is, Attack the Trojans off their guard, and
while they are in confusion, and ere they
regain courage and rally, seize on the camp.
Thiel takes turbata as proleptic in use (see

AEn. ii. 736), and interprete, “Attack the l

sl}

camp, and thus throw it into confixslonx·

15. Secuit arcum. So *τέμνειν οἷον, i.e.‚
incessit per arcum. Fuga, lugiens.

18. Nubibus is the abl. of the instrument, ξ’

“ Borne on by the clouds.’·

20. Tempestas is just exactly our word

sky,” which denotes the uppcr regions of
the air where storms originate in conse-
quence of the equilibrium οῗ the atmos-
pher c columns being disturbetl.

21. Palantes stellas—this means not the
planete only, but the whole body of the
stars, which, like a herd of cattle, browse
on the plains of heaven.

25. Ibat exercitus, etc„ are closely con-
nected with 30, ceu septem, the intervening
lin ss, 2⁷, 28, and 29, being parenthetic.

26. Dives is repeated instead of a copula.
See vii. 75. Pictm‘ vestio—see iii. 354. This
phrase, with auri, forms a heudiadys for
vestibus auro intexti&

“ bring up the rear.'‘ ..-.v
29. This verse has little MSS. authority
all the best copies do not contain it. ,
30. The comparison is— The army ιί
other times (in battle) rages furiously om
the plain, like the boiling tide of a swollcn
river, but now it advances quietly and
calmly, like the peaceful flow of a maJesth
s eam. >
surgens—‘⁴ increasing in its seven peace- .
ful channels.” Soon aster leaving the Montes ·
Emodi, the Ganges was said by the ancient·
to flow on in seven different channels. ·
31. Ρεν tacitum (scil, it), Le, tacite.
Similar phrases are, per longum, per subi-
tupffizirzfiffgllzt—eteviffl its fertilizIng
stream.
32. Refluit-“ subsides,” “returns {rom
the plains to its channel.'' In words com·
pounded with re, Virgil is wont to use the

35. Adi-ersa mole— “a height frontina
the approach of the Latins.”
37. Tela, adscendite. Some books mad

Tela. scandite, making the a os tela long
before the two consonante (sc) of the next
word, but this does not take place unless
the lengthened syllable be in arsis, which
here it is not. ’

43. The illustration represents one of tho.
Roman castella, or military forts, which were!
so frequent in the open country, to protect,
the boundaries of the empire, or to defend
the agricultural population stom the inroadnst
of hostile and plundering bordes. For a
description of the lar-ger castra camp, see
Ramsay's Antiquities.
