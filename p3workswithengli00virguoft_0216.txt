Β. X. 784-809.

784. Canum. aere, ie.. cineas-c, and made
of bronze. Trious tau-ria i.e., with three
buu hides.

786. Haud pertulit vires—‘⁸ it did not con-
tinue its force throughout-'¹

788. For femine the wulgar reading is
femore, but the former has the sanction of Ι
the majority of MSS. ἓ

791. Mortis casum. The latter word is
added to signify the very great disaster in
the death of one so young, so affectionate,
and so brave. Lausus appears to us in a
most favourable light, as the devotedly-
attached son of a father, who, though im-
pious, aud ‹letested by his fellow-mein and
‹letesting them in turn, yet exhibita tokens
of the strongest natural affection and gentle
regard to his own offsprhig.

792. Vetustas generally refers to the past,
but here to the future—‘⁴ distant posterity.'’
Tanto operi—‘⁶ to so noble a eervice,'' viz,
the saving of his father. Some take the
words as referring to the AEneid, as a nmq-
num et nobile opu-3.

794. Inque liyatus for §aliqum-sque (illiqu-
wsque) by tmesis—“entangled,'· “impeded”
hy the spear which had passed through his
ahicld, and penetrated his groiu.

796. Proripuie is read by Wagner, ete,
instead of the vulgar prorupit, audit seems
much more suitable, as it implies haste aud
quickness, while the latter signifies ser-enom.
As AEueas rises (assumentis) to inflict the
hlow with greater vehemence Lausus falls
beneath his hand.

799. Socii, etc—his compauions, shouting
loudly, second his efforts. Aba-et isin the
subjunctive mood, as expressing wish and
inclination. See AEu. i. 5.

808. With this simile compare Hom. Il.
xii. 156, and Ovid, Met. v. 15⁸.

805. Observe the homoioteleuton [see iii.
656} or similar endiny, in arator· and viator ,·
and the anaphora [see lii. 247] in the repe-
tition ot· omnis. These desects have made
some critics consider the passage imperfect,
and one of those which the poet had marked
out for revision and alteration. But this is
hyper-criticism.

806. Amnis ripis — “the banks of a
stream.'’ This refers, of course, to a deep
bank, hollowed out by an hnpetuous tor-
rent. There are many such qulleys in
southern countries, where the rains are sud-
den and heavy, or in mountainous regions,
where they are frequent, and where the
quickly·swollen stream gains force to wear

m labour.”

it may soon abate in violence, the subjunc-
tive expressing the with that it may soon

a ove, 799.

814. Extrema fila leyunt, ie.. gether the
straggling fibres to spin the last part of the
thread of Lausus' life. Exiqit—eee above.
682.

821. The feelings of pity attributed to
AEneas as he looks on the youthful warrior
lying in his gore, and the soitness oi a
father's heart displayed in the touching
recollection of Ascanius and the chauces to
which he is exposed, are eminently calcu-
lated to excite our compassion, and render
our interest in the scene and the characters
more intense.

824. For subiit, the reading adopted by
Wagner. Jahn, Forb„ etc, many editors
have sto-itan, but without sufficient MS
authority. lmaqo pietatis, ete, Le.. AEneas
pictured in his mind the effect that such a
scene would have on him, were he as a
father looking on his dead son, Ascanius.

825. Pro laudibus istis—“for these great
merits of yours,'' viz.. his bravery in con·
fronting a superior warrior, and his filiai
piety in endangerlng his life for his father's
sasety.

827. Habe arma tua. It was reckoned a
great honour to the dead not to despoil hinu
and it was customary to bury along with
men those things which they had delightcd
in when alive.

828. sn· qua est ea cura—“if that be ιιιῖ
satisfaction to you'' in your deatlu ⁴· t
you care for that.''

830. It is some consolation in defeat to
think that one has been worsted by a
worthy antagonist-

838. Fovet—“supporta'' “enses'' Fovet>
{Pcffifss’assssissffiffissss ‘biisstsssse‘i‘sstsseiiiffgeisst
rally “to tend,'' “take care of,'' in the
most suitable way. We have translated it
“supports3'’ an idea which seems most
npphcab1e, when we remember that the
neck was unwounded. aud when we take
into aecor-nt the word anhelans.

On the construction fusus barbam, see
AEn. i. 22²8.

839. Multum remittit—‘⁸ osten despatches.”
Some editors, Wagn.. Jahn, Gossr„ etc,
retain the vulgar reading multos.

845. Tendit palmas ad coelum. This ls
rather at variance with the usual character
οἰ Mezentius—see 743, 773. Inhaeret cor·
pore—“fondly clings to the body.'' Some
books read corpori, but virgil does not elide
a lll‘alllff vowel except after another long
s e.

Υ849. Morte tua—‘⁶ at the price of your
death.’' Instead of exitium, in tho next

line. some books read exsilium, but Mezea-
