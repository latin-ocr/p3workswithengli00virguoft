386. Cuspis here, as at i. 81, means the

lower end of the spear, the σαυρωτήρ.
AEneas supported himself by the spear as
often as he put forth the wounded limb.
Nitentem—this verb has two meanings,
either to suvport oneself by somethinsl, or to
giovesomcard. Both are probably implied
ere.

391. Iapis—instead of this word, Iapyx
ls found in some copies, but it does not
seem so appropriate as the former for the
name of a physician. There is obviously a

reference to the verb 1660'9021·

394. Dabat—‘⁴ offered to give,'’ as we see
by what follows.

395. Deposui parentis. The ancients were
in the habit of exposing invalids before
the doors of their houses and temples, in
the hope that they might be cured by some
chance passer by, who had once been af-
ilicted with the same or a similar disease,
or nt all events that they might restore to
the earth their last breath. Hence depositus
came to mean, “despair-ed os,” as here.
Fata, i.e.‚ mortem.

397. Mutus artes, viz„ medicine, and the
art of healing. The medical art is called
“silent,” i.e., “less showy.'' as compared
to tire more fashionable and showy accom-
plishments of augury‚ music, and archery,
and the term was more particulary appli-
cable among the Romans, who employed
«Em-ee, or libertini, or Greeks (Groeculi esuri-
entes), than it would be now-a-days. Forb.
thinks that mutas may be taken literally,
since the duty of the physieian must be
done in quietness and silence, while pro·
phecy, singing, and archery necessarily im-
pliec'. noise and excitement. This, however,
is rather prosaic.

398. Acerba fremens—‘⁴ murmuring bit-
terlyff’ wrathfully muttering bitter com-
p aints.

401. Paeonium is to be scanned as three
syllables, Poeonjmn. Jahn thinks that the
four syllables should be retained in full in
the scansion, the o being shortened, as the
i is in orichalcum, above, 87, and as the long
vowels of foreign words are often treated
by the Roman poets. Poeon. in mor„ “after
the manneroprollo.’' SeeArticle,“Apollo,”
in Clas. Dict.

Ille—senior. A substantive is osten thus
added to a demonstrative pronoun to im-
part emphasis, and to mark more distinctly
{gg person indicated. See note, AEn. v.

402. Manu medica, eto—“with heaiing
ekiu and with the powerful herbs of Phoebus,
be makes many anxious trials in vain—in
vain with his right hand he loosens [shakes
foggge purpose of loosening] the barbs, and

no degree directs to the means of cure, and
Apollo, inventor of the art, lends no assist-
ance. Horror, “ dread,” is put sor the
cause os dread.

408. Pulvere stare coelum, i.e., the (lust,
when it has once risen, combines with the
air, and makes it gain such consistency as
that the eompound seems to stand firm in
its place. The phrase is an imitation oi

411. Indismo dolore—“undeserved pain;'·
‘⁴ pain inflicted in a disgraceful manner.”

412. Dictamnus—the herb dittany, which
was found in great abundance on Mts. Dicto
and Ida. The herb now called dictamnus
by botanists is quite different.

413. Canalem, etc—“a stalk rich in ma·
ture leaves and purple flower;'' Le.. them
was on the stem an abundance of leave
(neither t-oo young and milky, nor too ol
and dry, but) of mature growth, and of full-
biown blossoms

414. Non imoqnita capris. Cicero, N. D.,
says that lt is reported that “when the
wild goats in Crete are hit with poisoned
arrows, they seek the herb dictamnus, ami
when they have tasted it the weapons drop
out of their bodies.”

417. Venus “with this herb infecta the
river -water (amnem), which had been
poured into the shining basin, secretly im-
parting to the liquid a curative power: she
sprinkles, too, the health-giving ,inice of
ambrosia, and the sweet—scented panacea.”

Panacea-( πᾶν, ἆκεῗσθαι)-αηὶιει·ῑ)κνὶιὶοὴ
was believed capable of curing all things.

Forb. and Wagn. ‘⁶ As was natural to ex-
pect.”

fresh to its former state.”
