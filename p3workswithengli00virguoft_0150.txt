and notes.

316. Trahere, scil.. res.

317. Coeant, i.e., be joined in a treaty, by
the marriage of AEneas with Lavinia Mer-
cede-‘⁴ price,” Le.. punishment, destruction.

319. Bellona pronuba—as J uno was her·
seli' Pronuba in chief, this transference or
her offices to Bellona is rather threatening.

320. Cisseis—Hecuba, daughter of Cisseus
and wife of Priam, who dreamed that she
was to bring forth a blazing torch, which
her son Paris turned out too truly to be.

Juqales, i.e., convuqales. ‘⁶ Nor diii the
daughter of Cisseus alone, pregnant with a
torch, give birth, in marriage, to a son who
proved a firebrand (to his country).''

322. Recidiva — “rising again from its
ruins.” The metaphor is taken from the
sprouting of young shoots out of a stock
whose tree has been felled. ”

323. We have now a description of the as-
cent of Allecto, one of the Furies, from the in-
fernal regions, at the instigation of J uno, and
of her dealings with Amata, the wife ot king
Latinus, with the Latin matrons, with Tur-
nus, the Teucri, and the aborigines. It is a
finely-finished passage, and called forth the
commendation of Juvenal, Sat. vii. 66 sq.
Cf. Eur. Here.- Fur. 822 sqq.; Hom. 11. ix.

565 sqq„ and Ovid Met. iv. 422.

324. Dactvflcus is found also in Cic. Tusc.
ii. 10, 25. Similar formations are terrificus,
horm‘ficus, ete. Allecto (written usually with
two l’s, though sometimes, both in Greek

and Latin, with one) is derived from ἆ,

priv., and λῆγομαι (1 eease)—it has been
translated impausabilis by Fulgentius, Myth.
i. 6. Dearum has in some editions been
supplanted by the reading sororum, which
latter was adopted to avoid the caeophony
of dirarum dearum. But the poet may have
intentionally used such a combination, “ ut
rem horrendam etiam duriore verborum sono
exprimeret.” Dirae, quasi deorum irae. But
it is rather to be referred to the adj. dirus,
which Doderl. thinks one and the same
with durus,· while Luenemann, in Lex„

deduces it from διερός (ἶῖω, δεἴδω) i.e.,
terribilis,- and the last editor of Forcellini's
Lex. considers it as a Sabine or Umbrian

wgrsso Noxia—“hurtfuL'’ “baneful.” Cf.

338, tibi mille nocendi artes.

327. odit, ete. Cf. Aesch. Eum„ 69 sq.,
