B. IX. 99-121.

meaning here is—And that AEneas, assured
of a favourable termination to his voyage,

should pass through dangers which, with-
out such assurance, would be of doubtful with adull and heavy rear. Ahoarse voice

issue.

99. otim quaecunque evaserit undas.
One had been sunk with Orontes on board,
AEn. i. 1133 four had been burned by the
women in Sicily, v. 699. Of the twenty
ships, therefore, only fifteen entered the
Ti er.

100. Laurentia arva, for in L. arva—see
AEn. i. 2, 307.

101. Efficiam, scil, ίίε, but this pronoun
is usually omitted after quicunque and quis-

ms.

q 102. Qualis N. D. et (qualis) Galatea
secant, i.e.‚ quales eunt Doto et Galatea, quae
tanquam Nereides tecam pontum. Qualis,
as we have noted above, is to be supplied
aster the eonJunction et, but secam applies
to both names conjointly. The two nymphs
named stand for the entire sisterhood.

3(2104. Stygii fratris, i. e., Pluto. See vi.

105. Torrere, says Heyne, proprie eu
calefaciendo siccare, tum cremare, tandem
ardere etservere. Jam quaecunqueservent
seu calore seu mota et impetu dicuntur el
ipsa torrere. Ita tandemflumina torrentia
sunt ferventia, rapida. But, he adds, the
rivers in the infernal regions are hurning
wilh fire. and in this sense torrentes may
here be taken, and especially so, because
at other times they are usually mentioned
as stagnant. The word pice shows, says
Forb„ that this second explanation is the
only true one. For as Ruhkopf remarks,
The banks boil with pitch=the Stygia„
water boils with pitch, i.e.‚ the Styx : and
since it was a lake-see vi. 369 compared
with 134 and 416 of the same book—rapidity
of motion cannot here be suggested.

107. Promissa, viz„ by Jupiter, as re-
corded above.

110. Nova—a strange and sudden light
burst upon (offulsit) their eyes.

111. Ab Aurora—from the east3 because
it came from the favourite haunts of Cybele,
Berecyntus, and lda.

112. Idaei chori. viz.. of the Corybantes,
who accompanied the mother of the gods,
and here were hid in the cloud. Cf. Ovid
Met. xiv. 536 sqq.

114. Ne trepidate—‘⁴ do not be in anxious
haste to defend,'' i.e.‚ do not trouble your-
selves about defending.

117. Deae is the nom. after ite, in oppo-
sition to vos. Et, ie., et statim, see v. 504.
Puppe-s —the sterns, as we have before seen,
were turned to the shore when in hai-bour.

121. This verse is devoid of MS. autho-
rity, andis either altogether omitted, or at
¹east marked with aster-isks as spurious, by
thegisest commentators.

from the water in their transformed aba} ι.. ⁷
125. Raueasonans—“soundinghoarsely,”

127. Ultro is here almost equal to aaa.
per, or adeo—see Geo. iv. 204. “Nay
rather;” “onthe contrary,''i.e., as explained
previously, (ii. 145), ‘⁸ contrary to what
you would expect.” This line isan example
of the figure epanalepsis, for an explanation
of which see i. 750, note.

128. Petunt—“are aimed against.” Mon-
stra—‘⁶ prodigies of evil omen.'' The mean-
ing of the following passage is, Jupiter has
deprived them of their wonted means of es·
cape, viz., the ships, which saved them from
the burning Troy3 and now they wait for
neither the missiles nor the torches of the
Rutulians, i.e.‚ there will be no need of either
to complete their destruction-all hope of
ssight is now cut off, for of the two means
by which they might effect it, one (pars
altera), the sea, is now out of their power;
the other, the land, is in our hands, for we
occupy the surrounding country, and have
them pent up within their entrenchments.

132. Tot millia is in apposition to gentes.
i{The Italian nations, so many thousands

number.''
29ῗ35. Veneri-see AEn. i. 257 sqq.; cf. ii. ν

138. Νεσ solos, etc. Nor does that cause
of grief affect (come home to) the sons of
Atreus alone.

140. Sed. But, says he, some ono may
object, that it is a sufficient punishment on
the perjured Trojans to have once suffered
the destruction of their nation and city
ch, replies Turnus, but in that case they
should have rested content with having
once carried off another man's wife, and not
have subjected themselves to a second
punishment by a repetition of their former
crime.

141. Modo non penitus perosos—“all but
hating with an irreconcileable hatred the
whole female race.” Per-asos agrees with
the subject. to peccare, which is not ex·
pressed.

142. Quibus. The omission of an ante-
cedent makes the construction somewhat
abrupt and harsh here. The harshness
arises from the excitement of mind iu tho
speaker. Supply some such phrase as, ¹⁸ Ο
foolish and silly men, to whom,'' etc.

143. On teti discrimina, see AEn. iii. 684,
and notes3 and cf. Hom. 11. xv. 628.

144. Non for norme. The meaning is,
But how can they feel any confidence when
thc regular fortification of a god-founded
city failed them ⁴?
