scribed.

301. Praefatus divos—“having first ad-
dressed the gods.'' 'Phe ancients (that is,
the more picus of them, as. for example,
Cato and Gracchus) did not deem it right
to begin a speech without invoking the
deities.

properly be represented by esc, the words
being thus arranged: est ante oculos inter-
que memus vestras, qua (i.e., quanta) ruina
teter-a omnia perculsa jaceam. Thus the
commentators3 but we are inclined to think
that omnia does not agree with ceter-2
(which already innp‘ics “all other thin93'’)
but that it means rzll <iata in the sense that,
“All the facts are manifest before you. (to
prove) in what a crippled state are our
other appliances of war ᾖα, our forces, and
munitionis of warj. ·’

312. Poma quae plurima virtus, etc.
