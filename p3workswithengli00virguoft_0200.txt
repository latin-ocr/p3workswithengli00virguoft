8. Heyne reekons this passage among
those which Virgil would have improved had
his life been spared: he objeets to it that we
have not been told previously that Jupiter
had forbidden the gods to encourage the
war between the Latius and Trojans, but
that, on the contrary, he had foretold to
Venus (AEn. i. 263), Bellum inqens aeret
Italici.- nor have any of them taken partin
it but Venus and «J uno. Forbiger, however,
replies that abnuere does not mean to inter-
dict, and he thus explains, “1 (says Jupiter)
was always averse ιο this war, and always
wished that AEneas should gain possession
of Italy without a contest, but the resent-
ment of «Iuno has frustrated my inten-
t ons.”

AEn. i. 203. The reference is to the devas-
lations by Hannibal in the second Punic

13. Immittet apertas Alpes— a highly
poetic and forcible expression. ‘⁴ Shali hurl
mighty destruction and the opened Alps
“gfissffligtssssttfissffiffssmffimw ..umngs
:nto confusion.'' The vulgar explanation is,
¹⁴ ιο plunder.” WVagn. interprets the phrase,
“bello lacessere alterum.” Tum is opposed

16. Non pauca. So Catuli, 55, 20, Ver-

bosa qaudet Venas loquela. Venus is called
aurea, in imitation of the Homeric χρυσῆ

Ἀφροδίτη, which means either “ altogether
beautifu1,'' as in Hor. Od. i. 5, 9, a girl is
spoken of as aurea, i.e., most beautiful, and

27. Heyne, Brunck, and others put a
semicolon after stoice, and a comma after
alter, connecting the words nec non exer.
alter with what follows, as if the poet were
speaking of two armies, (whereas he is merely
referring to the Troj an campaign,) and of the
similarity of this war ιο the former one.

28. Arpi, a famous city of Daunia, said
to have been founded by Diomede and his
