the whole nation.
·.196 Haud i‘ta— ‘it was not thus,”

as a coward and a conquered person, that
Pandarus and Bitias (on whom see ix. 672)
experienced me.

399. Nulla Salus. The words of Drances
in 362, are here repeated with much sar-
castic bitterness. Cane, etc—Foretell such
results thou madman, to (or, for) the Tro-
jan chief, and thine own cause!

402. Vir s bis vic tae. gentis—⁴ ‘the might
of the nation twice conquered (alrea‹1y⁰),''
ziz„ first by Hercules, and then by the
Greeks. Ρ r‘emere— ‘to dep reclatess'

403. This and the succeeding lines are
ironical. They insinuate that the refusal of
Diomede to enter into an alliance with
them against the TroJans is made up for a
purpose, and that the embassy sent to
Ap ulia had been fraudulently detained by
Drances. The train of ideas will be under-
stood by the following paraphrase: -0 ‘You
would make us believe, Ι suppose. that the
chiefs of the Myrmidons dread the Phry-
{³0¹2ss §23:335{hffss.3{2¹?531?22.22321525¹55
now, even the river Aufidus rushes back in
consternation from the waters of Hadria'·
'l‘he absurdity of the idea is heightened by
introducing the Myrmidons, who had no-
thing whatever to do with the affairs οῖ’
ltaly, and Achilles, now dead· ns ii he
were to say '‘,Oh d'on' t say Di‹ mede only
but tell us yat once that Achilles and all his
Myrmidons are terrified.’'

405. The Aufidus (Ofanto) was a river of
Apulia, flowing past Cannae, and emptying
ltself into the Adriatic. The name of the
river is put for that of Diomede and the
ApulianS.

406. Vel cum has given great difficulty
to commentatore, since (1) the sentence has
no apodosis3 and (2) this part does not
seem balanced with another portion in a
similar construction: and (3) there is 110

408. Talem animam—⁸ ‘such a craven
soul.'' Hac deteret, Le„ with this right
hand of mine thch meets 111 fight with
heroes only. Observe the keen bitterness
in the phrase, hrbr'tet tecum, et sit pectore
in isto.- “Let it abide with thyself [i.0.‚
soul and body are well matched‚ and ought
not to be disunitedJ, and remain in that
dastard breast of thine.''

412. Deserto} viz„ by Diomede, for he
was the only one asked to help them.

415. After quamquam we must under·
stand that there is a sudden break 111 tho
sentence (aposiopesis—see i. 135), for the
speaker, seeing that his sentiment would
not bc pleasing to many of his hearers, re-
frains from stating very broadly his disap-
proval of the prop osal to sue for peace, and
contents himself with indirectly signifying
his ideas by the opinion he expresses with
regard to the happiness of those who have
died before such a proposition has been
made. ‘⁴ Although—(me result ought tu be
sar ‹imaeue—(but) 0111 would that some-
wihat of our wonted valour were still dis·
p ayed '.''

The words ο] si solitae quidquam virtutis
adesset, may also be taken as a parenthesis,
and then quamquam will be connected im·
mediately with ille mihi, etc. This is the
plan approved by Wagner and Forbiger.

416. Mihi—“in my opinion.'’ Fortuna·
tus laborum—“happy in missortunes;''
laborum meaning the calamities of defeat
and death in battle. See xii. 727, and note.
Egregius animi—“noble in spirit.'' On
the construction of the two genitives, see
note 126, above. Semel—“once for all.'’

420. Urbes Italae—Italian cities, to contrast
with the Greek colony of Diomede, to which
an appeal had been made in vain.

423. Tempestas—‘⁸ the storm of battle.”

complete. As it is, it is ungrammatical,
unless we take nel cum for quid, or quod,
or quin etiam, as some (lo, explaining the
oddity as an archaism. Wagner, however,
iuliis small edition, supplies the apodosis
thus, quale illud est commentum? We
should, in this view, translate, ‘⁴ Ο, what a
salselzood is it, when this monster of deceit
pretends that he is in dread of my reproach-
sul threats, and embitters his accusation
against me on the ground of his (alleged)
fear.'‘ In our perplexity we are inclined
to adopt this interpretation as the most
feasible one we have seen.

407. Artfic
οἰ the syntax, for artare: scelestus, but in the

we have well entered 011 it.

425. Multa, etc—⁴ ‘Many things have
length of time, and the now favourable, now
adverse, toils of chequered ages restored to
a better condition: many persons has For-
tune, now kind, now adverse (alterna), 111
her returning visits mocked, and again (011
an after occasion) established on a solid

basis.” The Homeric parallel, νίκη δ’ ἔστι·
