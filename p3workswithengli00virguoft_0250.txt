820. Pro majestate tuorum, referring to
Saturn, and the fact of his being king in
Italy. He uses tuorum, as Latinus too had
his origin from the same source as Jupiter.

822. Leges e! foedera. This is said to be
hendiadys (see AEn. i. 2, note) for ,foedera
legibus (i.e., commonitam) ’‘nita. But we
rather think that foedera refers to the treaty
putting an end to war, and leges to the civil
laws which both are to observe after peace
has been cemented. and both nations incor-
porated into one under the name “ Latins.”
The following lines provide for other things
which shall preserve the nationality of the
people, but the leqes are matters to be dc-
0111οἀ by mutual consent. Mutare vocem—-
see AEn. iv. 618.

powerful, but as Italians, not 55 'stojan-s,

the credit of success.

830. For es some inferior books read et,
which has no MS. authority. The meaning
's‚ You prove y'ourselt to be a true sister os
Jupiter, and daughter of Saturu. for you
roll beneath your breast huge billows of
passion. Tantos is explanatory (“inasmuch
ns'’) ot'the t'oregoing line. Gossrau explains
thus: “You enjov the highest honour and
power after Jupiter, and yet you allow
yourself to get into such a passion.”

832. Submicte, Le„ depone, “lay aside.”
Inceptum, ie.. conceptum.

833. Remitto, ie.. 1 yield myself to 11100·
“ 1 so far 00550 from my opposition to your
wishes, being prevailed on by you, nay,
rather of my own wish and inclination.''
